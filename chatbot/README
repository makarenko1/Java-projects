Below are examples of short conversations between two of my bots: Alice and Bob. Unfortunately, only short
conversations turned out to be meaningful.

Example 1:
User: I like muffins.
Alice: who said that?
Bob: completely agree with you.
Alice: wow, you are smarter than I thought.
Bob: oh, that was nice.
Alice: sorry, I can't say 'oh, that was nice.'.
Bob: who said that?

Example 2:
User: say muffins.
Alice: I heard that people usually like muffins..
Bob: I heard that it's not true.
Alice: speak louder, please. can't hear you.

Example 3:
User: say Java
Alice: I heard that people usually like Java.
Bob: speak louder, please. can't hear you.
Alice: yeah, totally.
Bob: say something, please.

I was forced to make more illegal request patterns because there were more illegal requests (almost all legal
ones were from the user. That is, from me). Below are the arrays of patterns:
Legal request patterns: {"well, if you insist I will say "+ChatterBot.REQUESTED_PHRASE_PLACEHOLDER+". "+
                          ChatterBot.REQUESTED_PHRASE_PLACEHOLDER,
                         "I heard that people usually like "+ChatterBot.REQUESTED_PHRASE_PLACEHOLDER+".",
                         "wow, people are so smart. They even invented "+
                          ChatterBot.REQUESTED_PHRASE_PLACEHOLDER,
                         "what is so special about "+ChatterBot.REQUESTED_PHRASE_PLACEHOLDER+"?"}
Illegal request patterns: {"sorry, I can't say '"+ChatterBot.ILLEGAL_REQUEST_PLACEHOLDER+"'.",
                           "speak louder, please. can't hear you.",
                           "can you repeat what you've just said, please?",
                           "I heard that it's not true.",
                           "who said that?",
                           "say '"+ChatterBot.ILLEGAL_REQUEST_PLACEHOLDER+"' yourself.",
                           "completely agree with you.",
                           "wow, you are smarter than I thought.",
                           "oh, that was nice.",
                           "say something, please.",
                           "I have a friend now. it's you, silly!",
                           "can you hear me?",
                           "yeah, totally.",
                           "no.",
                           "never been interested in that.",
                           "what do you want?"}
