Players' strategies:
1. Mr. Whatever
This player chooses a random row and a random column (in the borders of the game board). Then the player
tries to put a mark in the cell at that row and column. The process repeats itself until the mark is put. We
can notice that there is uniform probability to try putting a mark in any cell of the board. In particular,
because the player can only put a mark in empty cells, there is uniform probability to put a mark in any cell
of the board, as needed.
2. Mrs. Clever
The player chooses a random row, and then tries to put a mark in every column subsequently until the mark is
put. If the mark can't be put at this row, the process repeats itself. Because the game hasn't finished, it
is guaranteed that at some row in the board there will be an empty cell (so this process isn't infinite).
We can notice that this strategy is more effective than the strategy of Mr.Clever because it is more likely to
create a sequence of marks in the same row of the length that is needed to win.
Another (possibly good) strategy that wasn't implemented: choose a random boolean value. If the value is
true, then the player mimics the behavior of Mr.Whatever. Else, the player mimics the behavior of Mr.
Snartypamts. So, it will be with 50% chance better at strategy than Mr. Whatever and with 50% chance worse at
strategy than Mr. Snartypamts. All in all, it will be an "average" player. But this strategy failed the
wins probability tests.
3. Mr. Snartypamts
The player starts at the top-left corner of the board and traverses the board from left to right, from top to
bottom, looking for the first empty cell to put a mark at. This strategy guarantees that (without the
intervention of the other players) there will be winning sequences of marks.

Game results for the board with SIZE = 6, WIN_STREAK = 4:
1. 500 none clever whatever
=== player 1: 396 | player 2: 104 | Draws: 0 ===

2. 500 none snartypamts clever
=== player 1: 362 | player 2: 138 | Draws: 0 ===

3. 500 none snartypamts whatever
=== player 1: 484 | player 2: 16 | Draws: 0 ===

4. 10000 none whatever whatever
=== player 1: 4986 | player 2: 4960 | Draws: 54 ===

Notes:
The enum Mark is included in a separate file because this enum used not only in the Board class but in the
others also. So, it was done for the sake of modularity.
